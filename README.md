This is a quick workflow that executes bunches using [Brett Terpstra's "Bunch" app](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bunch/).

## Requirements
1. [Alfred App 3](http://www.alfredapp.com/#download)
2. [Alfred Powerpack](https://buy.alfredapp.com/)

## Commands
- `bn [input]`
    * Optionally uses the input to filter the list of bunches. Choosing the name of a bunch from the list will execute it if the app is open.
